## Electric Vehicle Dynamics and Control Project

This project, developed in Matlab/Simulink, provides a comprehensive learning experience in electric vehicle dynamics and control. Participants will:

- Gain insights into the physics underlying electric cars like the Tesla Model S.
- Construct a mathematical model for an electric DC motor.
- Formulate the mathematical dynamics model for a car.
- Utilize Simulink to implement engineering models employing various elements such as blocks, transfer functions, and MATLAB functions.
- Validate and optimize the model based on real-life performance data.
- Develop, test, and fine-tune a PID controller tailored to specific requirements, such as maintaining the speed of the Model S (cruise control). 

Through this project, participants will enhance their understanding of electric vehicle systems, modeling techniques, and control strategies, while gaining practical experience in simulation and analysis using Matlab/Simulink.
